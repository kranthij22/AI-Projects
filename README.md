## Assignment 1 :
### Self-Driving Cab
Let's design a simulation of a self-driving cab. The major goal is to demonstrate, in a simplified environment, how one can use reinforcement learning techniques to develop an efficient and safe approach for tackling this problem.

The Smartcab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. Here are a few things that we'd love our Smartcab to take care of:

Drop off the passenger to the right location.
Save passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off
Take care of passenger's safety and traffic rules.

The  task is to use Q-Learning for the self-driving cab problem:
